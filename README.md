## Description
Potential employers are looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications. I created this portfolio using React. It contains a short Life experience Profile, application samples of work I have done up to this point, a contact form as well as a brief view of my proficiencies in coding along with an option to download my Resume.

## Installation

Youâ€™ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.
